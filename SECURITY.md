# Report a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure practices:

- **Email us directly** at [security@silencelaboratories.com](mailto:security@silencelaboratories.com).
- **Do not** open a public issue in the repository until the disclosure process has been completed.

Kindly refer to the [OWASP Vulnerability Disclosure Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Vulnerability_Disclosure_Cheat_Sheet.html) as a guideline.
