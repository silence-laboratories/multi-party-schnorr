## Introduction
This is a high-performance threshold EdDSA/Schnorr signing protocol based on the paper [Simple Three-Round Multiparty Schnorr Signing with Full Simulatability](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/374.pdf).


This is a production-ready, audited implementation  and has undergone a comprehensive [security audit](./docs/Hashcloak-SilenceLaboratories_2025_04_09.pdf) by HashCloak.

## Features

- Distributed Key Generation (DKG)
- Distributed Signature Generation (DSG)
- Key refresh
- Quorum Change: change dynamically the set of participants adding or removing



## Installing, Testing, Benchmarks
### Building
```bash
cargo build
```
### Running Tests
```bash
cargo test
```


### Examples
Under <a href="./examples/">`/examples/`</a> directory there are examples on how to perform keygen, sign and refresh.

Running the examples:
```bash
cargo run --example keygen
cargo run --example sign
cargo run --example refresh
```




## Implementation Details

- This library provides Distributed Key Generation generic over any elliptic curve group that implements the `Group` trait from the `elliptic-curve` crate.
  We currently support threshold Schnorr signing with random nonce over curve25519 and Bitcoin Taproot Schnorr over the secp256k1 curve.








**The library does not support**:
- This library contains only the cryptographic protocol and does not provide any networking functions.
- The parties in the protocol do not authenticate themselves and do not establish e2e secure channels



### Feature Flags

| Feature            | Default? | Description |
